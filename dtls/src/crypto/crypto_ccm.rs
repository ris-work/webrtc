// AES-CCM (Counter with CBC-MAC)
// Alternative to GCM mode.
// Available in OpenSSL as of TLS 1.3 (2018), but disabled by default.
// Two AES computations per block, thus expected to be somewhat slower than AES-GCM.
// RFC 6655 year 2012 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6655
// Much lower adoption, probably because it came after GCM and offer no significant benefit.
